//Block Step Sequencer Demo
//For use on JamBox (HackerBox #0028)
//  Each of 8 buttons turns on or off a note for the current beat
//  5th knob raises and lowers tempo
//  4th knob controls volume
//  3rd knob shifts toward a square wav -- go retro!
//  2nd knob adjsuts pitch, makes things weird.
//  1st knob does nothing.
//
// This was originally adapted from the Jambox instructable at 
// https://www.instructables.com/id/HACKERBOX-0028-JamBox/, however
// it now bears little resemblance to the original.  This fixes a 
// bunch of issues present in the original example, which would just 
// produce varrying samples of garbled audio from the PCM chip
//  (*) The DAC expects its samples to be LSB
//  (*) The pre-buffered waveforms introduced weird noise at the
//      end of each cycle because they didn't end exactly at the
//      beginning/end of a complete cylce.
//  (*) Buffer timing issues caused the DAC to run out of bytes to 
//      stream before they could be recomputed.
//  (*) The original scale wasn't precisely tuned, which made chords
//      sound very disharmonius.
